# Contributing to EcoFavsManager

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EcoFavsManager! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Reporting Issues

Before creating a bug report, please check that an issue reporting the same problem does not already exist. If an issue already exists, you can add your comments or reactions to that issue.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the project to your own GitHub account. This serves as your own copy of the project and you can make all your changes here without affecting the original.

2. **Create a New Branch**: Branches help you to manage the changes you make. It is a good practice to create a new branch for every new feature or fix.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes and additions to the branch. Be sure to use clear, concise commit messages. It's good practice to include any issue numbers if your commits resolve specific GitHub issues.

4. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your changes do not break the project. Add or update tests as necessary.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your branch to GitHub and then create a pull request against the main branch of the EcoFavsManager repository. Provide a clear description of the problem and solution, including any relevant issue numbers.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure that your pull request is directed against the `main` branch for new features or `hotfix` branch for bug fixes.
- Include screenshots if your changes affect the visual elements to help the reviewers understand your changes.
- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
